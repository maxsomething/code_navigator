GETTING THE SENTENCE TRANSFORMER MODEL

Code_Navigator uses the sentence-transformers library (specifically the "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" model) to create vector embeddings of your code for the AI context system.

There are two ways to get this model:

METHOD 1: AUTOMATIC (Recommended)

You do not need to do anything manually.

Ensure you have an internet connection.

Run the application:
python main.py

On the first launch, the application will automatically detect that the model is missing.

It will download the necessary files (approx. 90MB - 120MB) from Hugging Face.

The model will be saved to:
./data/models/

Future runs will use this cached version offline.

METHOD 2: MANUAL / AIR-GAPPED

If you need to install this on a machine without internet access, you must clone the model manually on a connected machine and transfer it.

On a machine with Git LFS (Large File Storage) installed:

git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2

This will create a folder named all-MiniLM-L6-v2.

Move this folder into your project directory at this specific path:

code_navigator/data/models/sentence-transformers_all-MiniLM-L6-v2/

(Note: The folder naming convention is important if you want the library to find it automatically without modification, though usually, the automatic method is far less error-prone).

TROUBLESHOOTING

If the download hangs or fails:

Delete the data/models folder to clear partial downloads.

Check your internet connection.

Run main.py again.
